## Story
A century of darkness smothers the land beneath the Demon King’s throne of gold, guarded by knights that were reduced to hollow armor. You are one of them, cursed into a horrific form as you push through a ruined kingdom. Pandemonium is a dark-fantasy action-adventure platformer. Prevail and the restored ones whisper a final command—free the sun.
